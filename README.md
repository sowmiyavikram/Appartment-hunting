I am looking forward to move into a new appartment.From the given list of blocks i have to choose an appartment block that matches my preferences.
The given block is the dictionary data type.
I have created a function appartmentHunting and I am scanning through the data.
I am looking forward to move into a new appartment.From the given list of blocks I have to choose an appartment block that matches my preferences.
The given block is in the dictionary data type.
I have created a function appartmentHunting and I scanned through the given data.
I have created a loop and iterated through each block.
My requirement is gym,store and school.For each requirement,I need to scan the blocks and check it is 'True' or 'False'.
I have created another loop and iterating through the values of i,with the if condition.
I have created an outer set and appending the values of i to the set,whenever the condition is True.
My requirement is gym,store and school.For each requirement,I need to scan the blocks and check whether it is 'True' or 'False'.
I have created an empty outer 'set' and appended the values of 'i' to the set using add function,whenever the condition is True.
I have done typecasting here and converted list to set,because my function returns all the unique values that matches my requirements.'Set' will not support append method,so I have used add() function.
I have done typecasting again and converted 'set' into 'List',so that I can perform indexing,slicing and whaterver the methods I want,which cannot be done in 'set'.
I have used format string and printed the number of blocks that matches my condition.
I have created another loop and iterated through the values of 'i',with the if condition.
In the second loop,I have iterated through the dictionary.
I have used string formatting and if the condition is True,it will print the statement along with the value of 'i' passed and gives the places that is near my appartment.Or else if the condition is False,it will print the statement along with the value of 'i' passed and gives the place that I have to walk farthest.
I have choosen the first index value of the block that matched my preference.
Finally,I have returned the index value of the block that matched my preference.(i.e) elist[0].
In the output,there are 4 blocks that matched my condition and from that I have choosen only one block.
The index value of the block chosen is returned.
